# Emmanuel Asante - Machine Learning Porfolio

This repo represents my knowledge base for the basics of machine learning.
In this porfolio, I will 

1) Demostrate data exploration in C++
2) Implement linear Models in C++
3) Implement the same models in R and python
4) Perform more complex machine operationgs learning like image classification in Python

Here is a link to a website that hosts these various projects: Link

Additionally, I've inlcudeed a link to the individual write up here

1) Overview of Machine Learning:  <a href = "https://github.com/MannyE/Portfolio_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Homework%201%20-%20Overview%20of%20Machine%20Learning.pdf">Click here </a>

2) Data Exploration in C+

3) Implementing Linear Models in R

4) Machine Learning Algorithms implemented in C++

5) Similarity and Ensemble

6) Introduction to Machine Learning with python and SKLearn

7) Image Classification with Tensorflow
