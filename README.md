# Emmanuel Asante - Machine Learning Porfolio

This repo represents my knowledge base for the basics of machine learning.
In this porfolio, I will 

1) Demostrate data exploration in C++
2) Implement linear Models in C++
3) Implement the same models in R and python
4) Perform more complex machine operationgs learning like image classification in Python

Here is a link to a website that hosts these various projects: Link
